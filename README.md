# Boston's Bluebikes OCT-DEC 2023 Analysis

### Project Overview

This project's objective is to provide insights on the number of bike riders and how much time they spent riding over the last quarter of 2023. By analyzing some KPIs from the dataset, we look to identify any trends, make data-driven recommendations, and hopefully gauge on the company's performance.

### About the Data

The primary dataset can be found on <https://bluebikes.com/system-data>. The months of October, November, and December, respectively, were downloaded and combined into a single file. "q4_2023_bike_editted.csv"

### Tools Used

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL - Data Cleaning & Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data loading and Joining
2. Data Cleaning and Sorting
3. Data Formatting and Transforming

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to answer key questions, such as, but not limited to:

1. How many total riders?
2. Where do riders start their bike rides?
3. Where do riders end their bike rides?
4. How many Casual members vs Subscribed members?
5. Which day of the week is the most popular day for riders?
6. How many minutes on average does a rider bike for?

### Results/Findings

1. Riders seem to have a decline as the year progressed. This could be because of the weather. Extreme cold temperatures could defer riders from traveling by bikes.
2. The popular starting AND ending stations were MIT at Mass Ave / Amherst St, Central Square at Mass Ave / Essex St, and Harvard Square at Mass Ave/ Dunster, to name a few. This could mean there is an increase in traveling frequency in these areas, hence the influx of bike rides from these respective locations.
3. Out of 876063 total riders, 674453 were subscribed members, which is around 77%.
4. Tuesday was found to have the most riders throughout the whole last quarter of 2023.
5. Riders spent on average, 10 minutes, on their bikes.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Implement a seasonal or yearly subscription, or a cheaper monthly price range to entice more customers to becoming members.
- Increase the number of bikes and/or docking stations at the more popular stations to attract even more riders.
